CoursePeer Sample PHP Application

This application uses one of the open source implementations for OAuth 2.0 (http://oauth.net/2/) on PHP.
This example uses CodeIgniter (http://codeigniter.com). However, you don't need to have any experience 
using CodeIgniter to start using this sample app. Also, this sample includes the core graph library that
is already configured to work with CoursePeer's OAuth 2.0 server.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start using this sample, you need to implement the following steps:

- Aquire your CoursePeer Application's APP_KEY and APP_SECRET. To get these, please send an email to 
  support@coursepeer.com and list the following details:
	* Application Name
	* Callback (redirect) URL - note that if you are using this sample application,
		then 'http://SITE_HOST/CP_APP_PATH/graph/index.php/signin/redirect'
		should be your Callback URL, where your own site host (i.e. domain name OR 
		IP Address of the hosting server), and CP_APP_PATH is the full path (if any), 
		where the files and folders reside on your server.
	* Developer’s Email Address
	* MiniFrame URL (optional)
	* Developer’s Website (optional).
- Create a new database and then execute the SQL statements available inside the 'coursepeer_app.sql' file.
- Edit the first chunk of constants in the file "graph\application\config\constants.php". Comments are self explanatory in that file.
- Edit 'index.php' to whatever that suits your needs.
- (OPTIONAL) Edit 'graph\application\controllers\signin.php' to suit your needs. Comments are self explanatory in that file.
- Test! (access in your browser: http://SITE_HOST/CP_APP_PATH)
